	// You have been asked to make a function called WebsiteRacer which takes two URLs
	// and "races" them by hitting them with an HTTP GET and returning the URL which
	// returned first. If none of them return within 10 seconds then it should return
	// an error.

	// For this, we will be using:
	// - net/http to make the HTTP calls.
	// - net/http/httptest to help use test them.
	// - goroutines.
	// - select to synchronise processes.
